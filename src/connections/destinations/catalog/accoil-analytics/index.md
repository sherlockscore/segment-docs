## Supported Methods

Accoil supports the following Segment methods, which map directly to Accoil’s API:

**1. Identify**
- **Purpose**: Recognizes individual users and their attributes.
- **Example Call**:
   ```javascript
   analytics.identify('userId123', {
     email: 'user@example.com',
     name: 'John Doe',
     createdAt: '2023-05-12T08:00:00Z'  // ISO 8601 or Unix timestamp format
   });
   ```

**2. Group**
- **Purpose**: Links users to accounts and records account-level attributes.
- **Example Call**:
   ```javascript
   analytics.group('accountId123', {
     name: 'Example Company',
     createdAt: '2021-03-15T09:00:00Z',  // ISO 8601 or Unix timestamp format
     mrr: 3000,
     status: 'active'
   });
   ```

**3. Track**
- **Purpose**: Records specific user actions, such as "Login" or "Purchase."
- **Recommendation:** Use the Noun_Verb format to name your events, e.g., `Report Created`, `Purchase Completed`.
- **Example Call**:
   ```javascript
   analytics.track('Purchase Completed', {
     item: 'Book',
     price: 25.00
   });
   ```

**4. Page and Screen**
- **Purpose**: Converts navigation calls into Track events to monitor user interactions within your product.
- **Example Calls**:
   ```javascript
   analytics.page('Home Page');
   analytics.screen('Dashboard');
   ```
- **In Accoil**: These calls are transformed into events such as `Page Viewed Home Page` and `Screen Viewed Dashboard`, with the page or screen name as the event name.

## Key Notes

- **Created At Date**: Ensure the `createdAt` field for users and accounts is in ISO 8601 or Unix timestamp format for accurate tenure tracking.
- **Trait Handling**: Accoil stores traits sent with Identify and Group calls, but traits passed with Track calls are not stored. Only event names and counts are recorded.
- **Event Aggregation**: Accoil simplifies event tracking by aggregating daily event counts.
- **Page and Screen Calls**: These calls are automatically converted into Track events for easier monitoring of user navigation.
